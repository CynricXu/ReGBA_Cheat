 * MenuModifyFunction is the type of a function that acts on an input in the

 *     a pointer to the active menu. On exit from the function, the menu may
 *     be modified to a new one, in which case the function has chosen to
 *     activate that new menu; the EndFunction of the old menu is called,
 *     then the InitFunction of the new menu is called.
 * 
 *     The exception to this rule is the NULL menu. If NULL is chosen to be
 *     activated, then no InitFunction is called; additionally, the menu is
 *     exited.
 *   2: On entry into the function, points to a memory location containing the
 *     index among the active menu's Entries array corresponding to the active
 *     menu entry. On exit from the function, the menu entry index may be
 *     modified to a new one, in which case the function has chosen to
 *     activate that new menu entry. If the menu itself has changed, the code
 *     in ReGBA_Menu will activate the first item of that menu.
