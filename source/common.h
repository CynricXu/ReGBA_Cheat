 *    the audio hardware takes the buffer before returning zero.
 * c) The function finds that the return value of ReGBA_GetAudioSamplesAvailable

 *    the status of the audio hardware, looping until it's available before
 *    returning zero.
 * d) The function finds that the return value of ReGBA_GetAudioSamplesAvailable

 * 
 * Input:
 *   (implied) ReGBA_GetAudioSamplesAvailable: The return value of this core

 *   consumes them. Even if the user requests muting the audio, this function
 *   MUST be called in order to prevent the accumulation of audio in the
 *   core's buffer; this will prevent echoes and clipping when the user
 *   requests unmuting the audio.
